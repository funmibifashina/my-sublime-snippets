===================

These are the code snippets I use in Sublime Text 2.

Installation
------------
Save the snippet files in **Packages/User**. You can locate your Packages directory through the main menu: **Preferences > Browse Packages**

Usage
-----
Snippets save you from tedious typing. They are templates of frequently-used text that autocomplete for you. To use a snippet, type the **Trigger** text, then hit **TAB** to insert the snippet. Then continue hitting **TAB** to cycle through all the available fields.


The Snippets
------------

The underscores in the result represent fields. You can cycle through them by hitting **TAB**
